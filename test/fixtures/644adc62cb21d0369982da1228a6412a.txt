    "description": "Story: Lewis wants to say his love to Vivi(light blue character) which in the beginning it shows the dashboard with purple sparks causing them to stop by a mansion in the dark wood. The group which consist of Vivi, Arthur(Yellow), and Mystery(Dog) to enter the mansion Vivi is astonish of the mansion, Arthur is afraid of it and Mystery is getting a weird but familiar vibe from the place. Upon falling from a never ending hole it show three mirrors to the group. For Vivi it shows her reflection but without her eyes. For Arthur it shows him without his robot arm and for Mystery it doesn't show because it cracks meaning to hide his true self. after the mirrors, Arthur is pulled down instead of Vivi by mistake. Which Arthur is frightened for life when see the coffin and the being exiting the coffin. Which is Ghost Lewis thinking it was Vivi until he had a good look at him and cursed at him. He got agroed and lit the lamps and his hair before chasing Arthur then the other two. Upon the chase Mystery stopped in front of a strange mirror playing a memory from the past. Explaining everything that happened. Starting with the van then Lewis,when he was alive, driving, Vivi sitting in the middle next to Lewis and Mystery. And Arthur in the back which he started to sulk when Vivi and Lewis looked at each other. They stop to an up coming spooky cave and wanted to investigate.  Lewis dumb founded about the place, Vivi curious about the cave, Arthur not wanting to be there and Mystery getting a strange vibe.the group split into two Vivi and Mystery taking the right path while Lewis and Arthur taking the left path. Seeing it that Lewis led a dead end he still wanted to check its depth. Vivi is shown at the  bottom of the cave floor without Mystery because he was behind Arthur to check on him. Which Mystery hunch was right about the strange vibe which an evil ghost possesses Arthur making him push Lewis. When Lewis dies Lewis becomes the skull ghost, Vivi loses her memories about him and incident, Arthur loses his left arm and at the end it show Mystery's true self of be a nine tail fox with a severed arm in his mouth. Back to the present Ghost Lewis continues to chase after the group mainly Arthur for pay back but Vivi intervenes causing Ghost Lewis to stop and get closer to Vivi. Once they were close enough Ghost Lewis tries to offer his floating pulse heart to Vivi but Arthur stopped by pulling her away. Which caused the heart to fall and crack and for Ghost Lewis to charge his powers to a ball of flames of his color and shoot across the hallway. Luckily the group fled in the van safely. Ghost Lewis watched go as the camera goes to show the heart to reveal its a locket with a photo with Lewis and Vivi. Ghost Lewis reverts back to normal Lewis with a tear falling down before he disappears then the mansion which is where the cave was.\n\nMystery is Arthur's Dog because of the yellow glasses that he is wearing.\nVivi was Lewis' soon to be or already girlfriend because of the purple glasses.\n\nAt 1:12 of the video it show four visible paintings. A noble, a masked wrestler on the left. on the right a madam and a priest. The priest is from the original Mystery Skulls - Ghost.\n\n\nLyrics:\n'Cause the world might do me in\nIt's all right cause I'm with friends\nCause I'm giving up again\nIt doesn't matter\n\nAnd I'm feeling like a ghost\nAnd it's what I hate the most\n'Cause I'm giving up again\nAnd this time (this time, this time)\n\nThis time I might just disappear (oh yeah)\noh-ho-oh\nThis time I might just dis-\nNo-no-no oh no-no-no(oh yeah)\nNo-no-no oh\nThis time I might just disappear\noh-ho-oh\nThis time I might just dis-\nNo-no-no oh no-no-no(oh yeah)\nNo-no-no oh\n\nTry and hear me then I'm done\n'Cause I might just say this once\nSeen this played out in my dream\nIt doesn't matter (hmm-hmm-hmm)\n\nTime for givin' up the ghost\nFuck, it's you I hate the most\nAnd there is no guarantee\nIt doesn't matter\n\n(x3)\nThis time I might just disappear(oh yeah) \noh-ho-oh\nThis time I might just dis\nNo-no-no oh no-no-no(oh yeah)\nNo-no-no oh\nThis time I might just disappear\noh-ho-oh\nThis time I might just dis\nNo-no-no oh no-no-no(oh yeah)\nNo-no-no oh\n\n\n\nI do not own the footage or music in the background. all rights go to MysteryBen27 and Mystery Skulls.",

Lewis and Vivi have been my favorite couple right now. Arthur and Ben are just too interesting. Mystery Skulls and Mystery Ben are a killer duo if you ask me!

     "description": ".::::KATHY-CHAN AMVs/PVs::::.\n\"This time I might just disappear.\"\nHEY GUYS LONG TIME NO SEE OR HEAR! LEMME BRING YOU SOMETHING COOL AND TOTALLY NOT BANDWAGON ヽ(*・ω・)ﾉ\n\nHey guys! Thanks for the 6k subs! I couldn't have done it without you! Don't worry, this isn't my 6k video, but it's something I have been fanning about and decided to share! It's pretty short and I'm so FRIGGIN' SORRY, but this is just to cool down the fangirls inside me. 8'D Ghosts has been in my head ever since I first heard it and I have fallen in love with the story and it's adorable characters! Lewis and Vivi have been my favorite couple right now. Arthur and Ben are just too interesting. Mystery Skulls and Mystery Ben are a killer duo if you ask me! Consider this a small tribute to this HUGE fandom.\n\nEnjoy! ヽ(*・ω・)ﾉ♥\n\n\n★CREDITS★\nMusic: Ghost\nVocals: Mystery Skulls\nhttps://www.youtube.com/mysteryskullstv\nCharacters originally made by Mystery Ben\nhttps://www.youtube.com/MysteryBen27\nPV: Kathy-chan\n► Here is the original song used: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrKYSL2_psQ\nHere is MysteryBen's video for it:\n►https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlEb3L1PIco\n\nCharacters: Lewis/Pink || Vivi/Blue || Arthur/Yellow || Ben/Dog\nAll the art I used is from Deviantart:\nkatestrife\nyuramec\nnaimly\nmiss_mixi\ntransientday http://www.deviantart.com/art/Mystery-Skulls-Ghost-491831177\nplease lemme know if any of this art is yours, so I can add it here!\n\nヽ(*・ω・)ﾉCONTACT ME: \n☆FACEBOOKIE: https://www.facebook.com/animerocker246 ☆\n☆TWITTER BIRD THINGY: https://twitter.com/SmangoKat246 ☆\n\"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
